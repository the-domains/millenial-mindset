Welcome to **Millenial Mindset**!

My name is Ryan. I'm a 22-year-old (nearly 23, yikes) alumnus of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. I currently work for an international facility management firm in Downtown Nashville, which is actually my second "real adult" job after college. 

**What I hope for this site**

In all my various leadership classes, on social media, on television, _nearly everywhere,_ I've seen numerous papers, articles, posts, memes, _et cetera ad nauseum _how Millenials are simply ruining everything. The workplace, relationships, politics, and a host of other aspects of life. This [Time article][0] delves into some of those... ideas.

I want to prove them wrong. Negative stereotypes are a near-constant refrain for older generations, stubbornly refusing to see what we [bring to the table][1]. 

((Check out this awesome[interactive infographic][2] from Goldman Sachs.))

**That's it? A site about defeating anti-Millenialism?**

Nope. That's the stretch goal, the overarching theme, the long-term trend.

I'm gonna make this my own space, to share things I find intersting, pieces of my life, and all manner of things. All in all, this site is going to be an extension of myself. Naturally, it'll evolve over time, so let's just enjoy the ride.
